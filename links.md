Tarballs provide a versatile way to back up and manage groups of files on Linux systems. Follow these tips to learn how to create them, as well as extract and remove individual files from them.

## 3. [What Are Some Reasons You Would Use Disk Partitioning](https://ostoday.org/linux/what-are-some-reasons-you-would-use-disk-partitioning-before-installing-linux.html)<br>

Partitioning a disk can make it easier to organize files, such as video and photo libraries, especially if you have a large hard drive. Creating a separate partition for your system files (the startup disk) can also help protect system data from corruption since each partition has its own file system.

## 4. [What Is NFS? Understanding the Network File System](https://www.atera.com/blog/what-is-nfs-understanding-the-network-file-system/)<br>

A Network File System or NFS is necessary for helping your business share files over a network. An NFS is a protocol that lets users on client computers access files on a network. You can access remote data and files from anything that links to the network you will use. All people within a network will have access to the same files, making file-sharing efforts easier.

## 5. [What Is NTFS and How Does It Work?](https://www.datto.com/blog/what-is-ntfs-and-how-does-it-work)<br>

NT file system (NTFS), which is also sometimes called the New Technology File System, is a process that the Windows NT operating system uses for storing, organizing, and finding files on a hard disk efficiently.

## 6. [Disk Partitioning in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-partitioning-in-linux/)<br>

Disk Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into one or more logical areas, often known as partitions, on which the user can work separately. It is one step of disk formatting. If a partition is created, the disk will store the information about the location and size of partitions in the partition table. With the partition table, each partition can appear to the operating system as a logical disk, and users can read and write data on those disks.

## 7. [What is a Bash Script?](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-script.php)<br>

This page is mostly foundation information. It's kinda boring but essential stuff that will help you to appreciate why and how certian things behave the way they do once we start playing about with the fun stuff (which I promise we'll do in the next section). Taking the time to read and understand the material in this section will make the other sections easier to digest so persevere and it'll be well worth your time.

## 8. [Virtual Storage](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch05.html)<br>

As the virtual machine will most probably expect to see a hard disk built into its virtual computer, Oracle VM VirtualBox must be able to present real storage to the guest as a virtual hard disk.

## 9. [Linux File System](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-file-system)<br>

A Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition. A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data. In our machine, there can be various partitions of the memory. Generally, every partition contains a file system.

## 10. [Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-file-hierarchy-system)<br>

Filesystem hierarchy standard describes directory structure and its content in Unix and Unix like operating system. It explains where files and directories should be located and what it should contain.

# Week 4

## 1. [Clear RAM Memory Cache, Buffer and Swap Space](https://www.tecmint.com/clear-ram-memory-cache-buffer-and-swap-space-on-linux/)<br>

Like any other operating system, GNU/Linux has implemented memory management efficiently and even more than that. But if any process is eating away your memory and you want to clear it, Linux provides a way to flush or clear ram cache.

## 2. [Memory Utilization in Linux](https://www.tothenew.com/blog/understanding-memory-utilization-in-linux/)<br>

inux is an awesome operating system. It performs good with fewer resources and tries to maximize utilization of available resources automatically and because of this, it’s slightly difficult to understand resource utilization.

## 3. [Find Out the Total Physical Memory (RAM) on Linux](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/total-physical-memory)<br>

ometimes, we might need to check for total memory size on a server running Linux or we might need to use memory stats in shell scripts. Fortunately, we have access to numerous tools that we can use to check for total physical memory. In this tutorial, we’re going to take different approaches to serve that purpose by using several useful commands and tools.

## 4. [Free vs. Available Memory in Linux](https://haydenjames.io/free-vs-available-memory-in-linux/)<br>

At times we will need to know precisely how our Linux systems use memory. This article will examine how to use the free command-line utility to view memory usage on a Linux system. In doing so, we will clearly define the difference between free vs. available memory on Linux systems.

## 5. [How to Use Pointers in C](https://linuxhint.com/use-pointers-c/)<br>

In C, learning pointers is simple and enjoyable. Certain Programming language activities are easier to complete with pointers, while others, like dynamic memory allocation, seem impossible to complete without them. To be a competent C developer, it is thus beneficial to understand pointers. Within C, a pointer is a variable that holds the location of some other variable.

## 6. [C development on Linux](https://linuxconfig.org/c-development-on-linux-pointers-and-arrays-vi)<br>

You probably know that operating systems deal with addresses when storing values, just as you would label things inside a warehouse so you have an easy way of finding them when needed. On the other hand, an array can be defined as a collection of items identified by indexes. You will see later why pointers and arrays are usually presented together, and how to become efficient in C using them.

## 7. [What Is Little-Endian And Big-Endian Byte Ordering?](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/what-is-little-endian-and-big-endian/)<br>

Computers store data in memory in binary. One thing that is often overlooked is the formatting at the byte level of this data. This is called endianness and it refers to the ordering of the bytes. Specifically, little-endian is when the least significant bytes are stored before the more significant bytes, and big-endian is when the most significant bytes are stored before the less significant bytes.

## 8. [How is Virtual Memory Translated to Physical Memory?](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/03/how-is-virtual-memory-translated-to-physical-memory.html)<br>

Memory is one of the most important host resources. For workloads to access global system memory, we need to make sure virtual memory addresses are mapped to the physical addresses. There are several components working together to perform these translations as efficient as possible. This blog post will cover the basics on how virtual memory addresses are translated.

## 9. [Pointers in C Programming](https://www.guru99.com/c-pointers.html)<br>

The Pointer in C, is a variable that stores address of another variable. A pointer can also be used to refer to another pointer function. A pointer can be incremented/decremented, i.e., to point to the next/ previous memory location. The purpose of pointer is to save memory space and achieve faster execution time.

## 10. [Does Linux Use Less RAM Than Windows?](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-windows-ram/)<br>

It depends. Windows and Linux may not use RAM in exactly the same way, but they are ultimately doing the same thing. So which one uses less RAM?

# Week 5

## 1. [Demand Paging in OS](https://digitalthinkerhelp.com/demand-paging-in-os-operating-system-examples-advantages-working/)<br>

Demand paging is a process of swapping in the Virtual Memory system. In this process, all data is not moved from hard drive to main memory because while using this demand paging, when some programs are getting demand then data will be transferred.

## 2. [Virtual and Physical Addresses](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs350/F06/slides/cs350_D.pdf)<br>

Physical addresses are provided by the hardware, Virtual (or logical) addresses are provided by the OS kernel. OS divides physical memory into partitions. Different partitions can have different sizes

## 3. [What is virtual memory?](https://techmonitor.ai/what-is/what-is-virtual-memory-4929986)<br>

Virtual memory is a feature of an operating system that enables a computer to be able to compensate shortages of physical memory by transferring pages of data from random access memory to disk storage. This process is done temporarily and is designed to work as a combination of RAM and space on the hard disk. This means that when RAM runs low, virtual memory can move data from it to a space called a paging file. This process allows for RAM to be freed up so that a computer can complete the task.

## 4. [How Big Should Your Page File or Swap Partition Be?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196238/how-big-should-your-page-file-or-swap-partition-be/)<br>

According to an old rule of thumb, your page file or swap should be “double your RAM” or “1.5x your RAM.” But do you really need a 32 GB page file or swap if you have 16 GB of RAM?. You probably don’t need that much page file or swap space, which is a relief considering a modern computer might have a solid-state drive with very little space.

## 5. [How to create and activate a paging file on the Linux command line](https://www.tremplin-numerique.org/en/how-to-create-and-activate-a-exchange-file-on-the-linux-command-line)<br>

As you learn what a sawp file is and does, you will learn how to create and activate one on your Linux instance. Armed with this knowledge, you will be able to ensure that your system will no longer run out of memory.

## 6. [What are the Page Replacement Algorithms?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-are-the-page-replacement-algorithms)<br>

This lesson will introduce you to the concept of page replacement, which is used in memory management. You will understand the definition, need and various algorithms related to page replacement. A computer system has a limited amount of memory. Adding more memory physically is very costly. Therefore most modern computers use a combination of both hardware and software to allow the computer to address more memory than the amount physically present on the system. This extra memory is actually called Virtual Memory.

## 7. [Page Replacement Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>

In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when new page comes in. 

## 8. [What is Thrash?](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-thrash#:~:text=Thrashing%20is%20when%20the%20page,to%20be%20reduced%20or%20negligible.)<br>

In computer science, thrash is the poor performance of a virtual memory (or paging) system when the same pages are being loaded repeatedly due to a lack of main memory to keep them in memory. Depending on the configuration and algorithm, the actual throughput of a system can degrade by multiple orders of magnitude. 

In computer science, thrashing occurs when a computer's virtual memory resources are overused, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, inhibiting most application-level processing. It causes the performance of the computer to degrade or collapse. The situation can continue indefinitely until the user closes some running applications or the active processes free up additional virtual memory resources.

## 9. [Copy-on-Write in Operating System](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/copyonwrite-in-operating-system)<br>

Copy-on-Write(CoW) is mainly a resource management technique that allows the parent and child process to share the same pages of the memory initially. If any process either parent or child modifies the shared page, only then the page is copied.

The CoW is basically a technique of efficiently copying the data resources in the computer system. In this case, if a unit of data is copied but is not modified then "copy" can mainly exist as a reference to the original data.

## 10. [NUMA (non-uniform memory access)](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/linux-windows-ram/)<br>

NUMA (non-uniform memory access) is a method of configuring a cluster of microprocessor in a multiprocessing system so that they can share memory locally, improving performance and the ability of the system to be expanded. NUMA is used in a symmetric multiprocessing ( SMP ) system. An SMP system is a "tightly-coupled," "share everything" system in which multiple processors working under a single operating system access each other's memory over a common bus or "interconnect" path. Ordinarily, a limitation of SMP is that as microprocessors are added, the shared bus or data path get overloaded and becomes a performance bottleneck. NUMA adds an intermediate level of memory shared among a few microprocessors so that all data accesses don't have to travel on the main bus.


# Week 6

## 1. [Fork() in OS](https://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411.ck/www/NOTES/process/fork/create.html)<br>

System call fork() is used to create processes. It takes no arguments and returns a process ID. The purpose of fork() is to create a new process, which becomes the child process of the caller. After a new child process is created, both processes will execute the next instruction following the fork() system call. Therefore, we have to distinguish the parent from the child.

## 2. [Threads in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/threads-in-operating-system)<br>

A thread is a single sequential flow of execution of tasks of a process so it is also known as thread of execution or thread of control. There is a way of thread execution inside the process of any operating system. Apart from this, there can be more than one thread inside a process. Each thread of the same process makes use of a separate program counter and a stack of activation records and control blocks. Thread is often referred to as a lightweight process.

## 3. [Multithreading in OS](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-the-concept-of-multithreading-in-os-and-what-are-its-benefits)<br>

You are already aware of the term multitasking that allows processes to run concurrently. Similarly, multithreading allows sub-processes (threads) to run concurrently or parallelly. Also, we can say that when multiple threads run concurrently it is known as multithreading. Some widely used programming languages like Java and Python allow developers to work on threads in their program. In this blog, we will learn what are the various multithreading models and the benefits of multithreading in OS. So, let's get started.

## 4. [The exec family of system calls](http://www.it.uu.se/education/course/homepage/os/vt18/module-2/exec/)<br>

The exec family of system calls replaces the program executed by a process. When a process calls exec, all code (text) and data in the process is lost and replaced with the executable of the new program. Although all data is replaced, all open file descriptors remains open after calling exec unless explicitly set to close-on-exec. In the below diagram a process is executing Program 1. The program calls exec to replace the program executed by the process to Program 2.

## 5. [Using Makefiles](http://www.independent-software.com/operating-system-development-using-makefiles-and-second-stage-bootloader.html)<br>

This web explain about USING MAKEFILES AND THE SECOND-STAGE BOOTLOADER.

# Week 7

## 1. [What is Semaphore?](https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html)<br>

Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread. It uses two atomic operations, 1)wait, and 2) signal for the process synchronization.

## 2. [Introduction to DEADLOCK](https://www.guru99.com/deadlock-in-operating-system.html)<br>

Deadlock is a situation that occurs in OS when any process enters a waiting state because another waiting process is holding the demanded resource. Deadlock is a common problem in multi-processing where several processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a soft lock or software.

## 3. [What is a starvation problem in an operating system?](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-starvation-problem-in-an-operating-system)<br>

Starvation is the problem that occurs when low priority processes get jammed for an unspecified time as the high priority processes keep executing. A steady stream of higher-priority methods will stop a low-priority process from ever obtaining the processor. Starvation happens if a method is indefinitely delayed. This can emerge once a method needs a further resource for execution that isn’t assigned.

## 4. [Difference between Deadlock and Starvation](https://www.javatpoint.com/deadlock-vs-starvation)<br>

Deadlock and starvation are conditions in which the processes requesting a resource have been delayed for a long time. However, deadlock and starvation are not the same things in many ways. Deadlock happens when every process holds a resource and waits for another process to hold another resource. In contrast, in starvation, the processes with high priorities continuously consume resources, preventing low priority processes from acquiring resources.
In this article, you will learn the difference between deadlock and starvation. But before discussing the difference between deadlock and starvation, you must need to learn about deadlock and starvation.

## 5. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization)<br>

In this tutorial, we will be covering the concept of Process synchronization in an Operating System.

Process Synchronization was introduced to handle problems that arose while multiple process executions.

Process is categorized into two types on the basis of synchronization, Independent Process and Cooperative Process.

## 6. [Paterson Solution](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-paterson-solution)<br>

Peterson's algorithm (or Peterson's solution) is a concurrent programming algorithm for mutual exclusion that allows two or more processes to share a single-use resource without conflict, using only shared memory for communication. It was formulated by Gary L. Peterson in 1981.[1] While Peterson's original formulation worked with only two processes, the algorithm can be generalized for more than two.

## 7. [The Critical Section Problem](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)<br>

Critical Section is the part of a program which tries to access shared resources. That resource may be any resource in a computer like a memory location, Data structure, CPU or any IO device. The critical section cannot be executed by more than one process at the same time; operating system faces the difficulties in allowing and disallowing the processes from entering the critical section. The critical section problem is used to design a set of protocols which can ensure that the Race condition among the processes will never arise. In order to synchronize the cooperative processes, our main task is to solve the critical section problem. We need to provide a solution in such a way that the following conditions can be satisfied.


## 8. [Banker's Algorithm](https://www.javatpoint.com/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system)<br>

It is a banker algorithm used to avoid deadlock and allocate resources safely to each process in the computer system. The 'S-State' examines all possible tests or activities before deciding whether the allocation should be allowed to each process. It also helps the operating system to successfully share the resources between all the processes. The banker's algorithm is named because it checks whether a person should be sanctioned a loan amount or not to help the bank system safely simulate allocation resources. 

## 9. [Mutex – Mutual Exclusion Object](https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/mutex/)<br>

In computer programming, a mutual exclusion object (mutex) is a program object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but not simultaneously. When a program is started, a mutex is created with a unique name. After this stage, any thread that needs the resource must lock the mutex from other threads while it is using the resource. The mutex is set to unlock when the data is no longer needed or the routine is finished.

## 10. [Mutex vs Semaphore: What’s the Difference?](https://www.guru99.com/mutex-vs-semaphore.html)<br>

In this web, we can learn abaout Use of Semaphore and Mutex, Difference between Semaphore vs. Mutex, Common Facts about Mutex and Semaphore, Advantages and Disadvantage of Mutex and Semaphore.


# Week 8

## 1. [Process Scheduling]( https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling.htm#:~:text=Definition,of%20a%20Multiprogramming%20operating%20systems.)<br>

The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

Process scheduling is an essential part of a Multiprogramming operating systems. Such operating systems allow more than one process to be loaded into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

## 2. [Scheduling algorithms]( https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>

A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. There are six popular process scheduling algorithms which we are going to discuss in this chapter −

First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
Shortest-Job-Next (SJN) Scheduling
Priority Scheduling
Shortest Remaining Time
Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling

## 3. [difference between Preemptive and Non-Preemptive scheduling]( https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-preemptive-and-non-preemptive-scheduling)<br>

In the Operating System, the process scheduling algorithms can be divided into two broad categories i.e. Preemptive Scheduling and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. In this blog, we will learn the difference between these two.

## 4. [Big O Notation Explained]( https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-notation-why-it-matters-and-why-it-doesnt-1674cfa8a23c/)<br>

In this article, we will have an in-depth discussion about Big O notation. We will start with an example algorithm to open up our understanding. Then, we will go into the mathematics a little bit to have a formal understanding. After that we will go over some common variations of Big O notation. In the end, we will discuss some of the limitations of Big O in a practical scenario. A table of contents can be found below.

## 5. [Process State Models]( https://slaystudy.com/process-state-models-in-operating-system/)<br>

When a process is first created by the OS, it initializes the program control block for the process and the new process enters the system in Not-running state. After some time, the currently running process will be interrupted by some events, and the OS will move the currently running process from Running state to Not-running state. The dispatcher then selects one process from Not-running processes and moves the process to the Running state for execution.

## 6. [Multiple Processors Scheduling]( https://www.javatpoint.com/multiple-processors-scheduling-in-operating-system)<br>

Multiple processor scheduling or multiprocessor scheduling focuses on designing the system's scheduling function, which consists of more than one processor. Multiple CPUs share the load (load sharing) in multiprocessor scheduling so that various processes run simultaneously. In general, multiprocessor scheduling is complex as compared to single processor scheduling. In the multiprocessor scheduling, there are many processors, and they are identical, and we can run any process at any time.

The multiple CPUs in the system are in close communication, which shares a common bus, memory, and other peripheral devices. So we can say that the system is tightly coupled. These systems are used when we want to process a bulk amount of data, and these systems are mainly used in satellite, weather forecasting, etc.

## 7. [CPU Scheduling]( https://www2.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/6_CPU_Scheduling.html)<br>

Almost all programs have some alternating cycle of CPU number crunching and waiting for I/O of some kind. ( Even a simple fetch from memory takes a long time relative to CPU speeds. )
In a simple system running a single process, the time spent waiting for I/O is wasted, and those CPU cycles are lost forever.
A scheduling system allows one process to use the CPU while another is waiting for I/O, thereby making full use of otherwise lost CPU cycles.
The challenge is to make the overall system as "efficient" and "fair" as possible, subject to varying and often dynamic conditions, and where "efficient" and "fair" are somewhat subjective terms, often subject to shifting priority policies.

## 8. [What is Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Response time, Waiting time, Turnaround time, and Throughput?]( https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-burst-arrival-exit-response-waiting-turnaround-time-and-throughput)<br>

When we are dealing with some CPU scheduling algorithms then we encounter with some confusing terms like Burst time, Arrival time, Exit time, Waiting time, Response time, Turnaround time, and throughput. These parameters are used to find the performance of a system. So, in this blog, we will learn about these parameters. Let's get started one by one.

## 9. [Deadline Scheduling for Real-Time Systems]( https://study.com/academy/lesson/deadline-scheduling-for-real-time-systems.html)<br>

Real-time systems (RTS) are carefully designed systems consisting of software and hardware used to capture and respond to events occurring in the real world. Like many computer systems, the RTS process must operate correctly, but it has an additional requirement in that it must act in a timely manner. If an automobile's RTS controlling your brakes do not act in a timely manner, it may cause a catastrophic event. To accomplish this goal, the design engineer must carefully select from a variety of real-time scheduling options available. 

## 10. [Comparing real-time scheduling on the Linux kernel and an RTOS]( https://www.embedded.com/comparing-real-time-scheduling-on-the-linux-kernel-and-an-rtos/#:~:text=In%20a%20real%20time%20kernel,block%2C%20mutex%2C%20semaphone%E2%80%A6%20))<br>

By default, the Linux kernel build used in the many open source distributions is the normal/default kernel which doesn’t support real time scheduling. If an embedded developer wants to compare the scheduling policies of Linux to a real time operating system it is more useful to compare RTOS performance to a version of Linux that does have real-time features.

Fortunately, in addition to this default kernel, there is also available a Real-time kernel version that supports a real-time scheduling policy. In this article and in the code examples that are included, an effort is made to compare the real time operations of standard and real-time Linux with normal RTOS operation and evaluate the differences and similarities.

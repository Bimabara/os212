In this post we are taking a look at some commands that can be used to check up the partitions on your system. The commands would check what partitions there are on each disk and other details like the total size, used up space and file system etc. Commands like fdisk, sfdisk and cfdisk are general partitioning tools that can not only display the partition information, but also modify them.

## 2. [Working with tarballs on Linux](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3328840/working-with-tarballs-on-linux.html)<br>

Tarballs provide a versatile way to back up and manage groups of files on Linux systems. Follow these tips to learn how to create them, as well as extract and remove individual files from them.

## 3. [What Are Some Reasons You Would Use Disk Partitioning](https://ostoday.org/linux/what-are-some-reasons-you-would-use-disk-partitioning-before-installing-linux.html)<br>

Disk Partitioning is the process of dividing a disk into one or more logical areas, often known as partitions, on which the user can work separately. It is one step of disk formatting. If a partition is created, the disk will store the information about the location and size of partitions in the partition table. With the partition table, each partition can appear to the operating system as a logical disk, and users can read and write data on those disks.
